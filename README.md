In this project you are required to create a tab bar application with 2 tabs.

The first tab should present the following information:

• Your name

• The current Date and Time (should be updated dynamically every second)

• An Empty label (remember it!)

The second tab should contain two segments in a segmented control:

• The first segment contains a table that will show the information received from this RSS feed http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews

• The second segment contains a table which is a unification of the data received from http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/entertainment and http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/environment. First the items from “Entertainment” should be presented, and then the items from “Environment”

Requirements:

You can parse the RSS feed using any method you like.

Selecting a feed (a table item) will push a new view with the description of the feed.

The application should now present in the empty label of the first tab (remember?), the title from the feed that was selected in the second tab.

The application should check each RSS source (there are 3 RSS sources) every 5 seconds for an update and the UI should be updated immediately as soon as one of the RSS sources provided updated information. Note: You need to take into account the fact that the different RSS’s might have different response times.

Whenever the application checks for update, it should show an activity indicator that does not block the screen or the user from interacting with the application.
